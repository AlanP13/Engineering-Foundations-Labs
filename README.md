## 📘 Engineering Foundations Labs

This repository documents my early engineering training through a sequence of structured laboratory exercises focused on **instrumentation, measurement, data collection, documentation, and technical communication**.

While originally completed during my undergraduate foundation coursework, the material here represents the **engineering mindset and workflow** that later became central to my professional work in:

-   Data validation pipelines
    
-   Financial systems integration
    
-   ETL process design
    
-   Automated quality checks
    
-   Systems-oriented thinking

## 🧭 What This Repository Demonstrates

This is not a “class homework dump.” It shows:

-   How to **document engineering work**
    
-   How to **reason about systems and measurements**
    
-   How to **structure technical reports**
    
-   How to **communicate results**
    
-   How to **follow a process from requirements → experiment → analysis → conclusion**
    

These same patterns appear today in production environments (finance, data engineering, and systems integration).
